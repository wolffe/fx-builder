A simple page builder plugin. The one you can actually use.

== Description ==

**[f(x) Builder](http://genbumedia.com/plugins/fx-builder/)** is a new page builder plugin that provides visual columns in the post editor without using shortcodes. From the setting page, you can enable it for posts, pages, and custom post types. There is no vendor lock-in. If you decide you no longer wish to use the plugin, you can disable it without losing your content (though you would loose the column formatting).
